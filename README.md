## Overview
The Coffee Sales Analysis project involves analyzing historical sales data for a coffee business to identify trends, assess performance, and provide actionable insights. The project utilizes Excel to process, visualize, and summarize key sales metrics, helping to inform decision-making for product strategies and marketing campaigns.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze coffee sales data to identify monthly, seasonal, and regional sales patterns.
- Identify high-performing products and assess their contribution to overall sales.
- Evaluate the impact of promotions and discounts on sales performance.
- Provide recommendations for inventory management and marketing strategies.

## Key Steps & Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing data, and formatted the dataset for analysis.
   
2. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Grouped data by different dimensions, such as month, region, and product type, to evaluate trends over time.
   
3. **Sales Performance Analysis**:
   - Used Excel formulas (e.g., `SUMIFS`, `AVERAGEIFS`, `VLOOKUP`) to calculate total sales, average sales per month, and sales growth.

4. **Pivot Tables & Charts**:
   - Created Pivot Tables to summarize key metrics and generate insights.
   - Created bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to visualize sales trends and product performance.

5. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Applied conditional formatting to identify peak sales periods and low-performing products.
   - Utilized Excel’s data analysis tools to forecast future sales trends.

6. **Sales Forecasting**:
   - Implemented Excel’s built-in forecasting function to predict future sales based on historical data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: for data processing, pivot tables, charts, and analysis.
- **Formulas**: SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, VLOOKUP, COUNTIFS, etc.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts (bar, line, pie) for visual representation of sales trends.

## Conclusion
This project helped develop valuable skills in data analysis and visualization using Excel.
